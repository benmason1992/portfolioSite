                        <p>At the start of 2019 I made the decision to change my career and enter the tech industry as a developer. I have always been orientated towards tech and decided to try and move myself in that direction. In October 2019 I attended an open evening with DevelopMe and subsequently enrolled on their 12-week coding fellowship web developer bootcamp starting in January 2020.
                        I am now searching for a junior developer role so that I can continue to learn and grow my skills.</p>

                        <p>My previous employment was as an insolvency examiner with the Official Receiverâ€™s Office. I would investigate insolvencies and interview both bankrupts and directors, to build up a picture of what had occurred in the build-up to the court order. Prior to that but still within the civil servide I worked for HMRC as a tax officer.</p>
